### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! ðŸ‘‹

## WELCOME TO RESUME ONLINE PROJECT. ðŸ“„

<hr />

# this.Project ðŸ“–

Building a website based on the design reference.

## Why?

After completing my HTML and CSS course, I found this design offered by the author so people like me can practice building it using this design as a guide.
</br>
</br>

## How?

Despite being the beginning of my journey, I used advanced CSS techniques, such as flexbox and display grid, to construct this website.
</br>
</br>

## What?

Developing this single-page application was my first experience with JS: the logic to scroll the page from the menu.
</br>
</br>

## Design's credit for ?

Unfortunately, I lost the designer's name to give him credit. I'm so sorry, my friend! If anyone recognizes the design of this project and knows who the creator is, please contact me. Thank you!
